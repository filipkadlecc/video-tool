   * frames nobody will ever see. `exportedDurationInFrames` is the only number
   * here that is checkable: it is what the Player plays and what the renderer
   * writes. One composition in the corpus disagrees with itself three ways —
   * its comment says 580, its declared duration says 445, the parser reads 625
   * — and only one of those three ever becomes a file.
   *
   * The old worry does not disappear; it becomes visible. A composition whose
   * tail is cut off by its own declared duration now ends in a block that stops
   * at the boundary, on a timeline you can see and fix, rather than in a tail
   * that silently never renders.
