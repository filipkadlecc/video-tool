 * The branded scene library, as one list.

 * It used to be described in three places that disagreed: 29 files on disk, 21
 * with a display name in the snippets route, and 25 with a parameter schema. Of
 * those, only 19 were complete — and five (AccountCTA, ActorStoreCard,
 * ChartReveal, EventContour, HiringCard) have a schema but no name, so they do
 * not appear in the Snippets browser at all despite being fully built.
 *
 * Reading the directory is the source of truth for WHAT EXISTS; the name and the
 * schema are looked up and may be missing. A scene with no schema can still be
 * placed, it just has no parameters to fill in.
